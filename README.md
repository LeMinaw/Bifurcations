# Bifurcations

Hackable population based image generation software

## Wonder what it can do?

Here's a little exemple.

![alt text](https://github.com/LeMinaw/Bifurcations/raw/master/preview.png "population image")

Three populations, driven by the logistic_clamp law, plotted on [0, 4].

* Red population has fertility (y, 2, 2), blue has, (y, 3, 2), and orange has (y, 3.5).
* Red eats blue at a 0.3 rate and orange at a 0.4 rate.
* Blue eats orange at a 0.5 rate.
