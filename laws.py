"""This module is composed of function definitions describing recurrent population evolution.
Each function takes 3 args:
- pop: Population at previous state
- fertility: Fertility value, likely positive
- environment: Ponderated changes in population, eg. predation. Must default to 0, and can be either positive or negative."""
